# how to contribute
## use splay
right now, the most effective way to contribute is to try using splay. share
your boards, let me see how you're using it, and report back any problems or
annoyances that you and your readers encounter. 

## feedback of particular interest 
### platforms
 * how is the editing experience on mobile?
 * is splay sluggish on mobile / old computers?
 * does export/import work on iOS?
 * is a splay board readable on mobile?
 * do the emoji show correctly for you?
 * do you know how to type emoji without a built-in emoji picker?
 * do your emoji work for your readers?

### usability
 * is it easy enough to read a splay board without the tutorial cards?
 * how is the editing experience in general, could it be more self-explanatory?

### expressivity
 * does the card format limit expression too much? what is difficult to express?
   how could that be easier to express?
